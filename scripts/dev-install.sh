# Builds Bholeynath the way it runs every day (DebugCloud: signed with the Apple Development
# certificate, iPhone link on) and makes it the only Bholeynath: installed in /Applications,
# the copies left by earlier builds removed.
#
# Why: macOS gives its permissions (Accessibility, Screen Recording, microphone...) to one
# app signed one way. An unsigned Debug build looks like a new app after every build, and
# each copy of Bholeynath.app is one more entry to allow. One signed app at one place keeps
# its permissions from one build to the next.
#
#   ./scripts/dev-install.sh
#
# Use it instead of xcodebuild by hand or ▶ in Xcode (which leave copies in DerivedData).
